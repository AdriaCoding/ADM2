# Second delivery for the ADM project
#### Jan Herlyn & AdriÃ  Lisa

Under the folder 'scripts' you will find all the codes for the NeuralODE and Lokta-Volterra models, written in Julia. The codes used for the Linear Time Series models, like AR, SARIMA, etc. are all combined in the Jupyter notebook. We provide an explanation on how to run the julia scripts, as it is not as well known as the python notebook.

### Installing Julia
To install Julia, you can go the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the appropriate steps for your system. 

If you have added Julia to PATH, you can start a new session into the Julia REPL by just running "julia" (or else, run "/path/to/julia/bin/julia)" on your favorite command interface.
```
$ julia

Feel free to play arround with the REPL to be more familiarized with the language. I encourage checking out the [offical documentation manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/), and this [cool tutorial](https://youtu.be/EkgCENBFrAY?si=DTJ3SP1Shm0wYKTk) by Miguel Raz.

### Instantiating the Virtual Environment
Our project requires several very specific dependencies.
